.. _connect-tool:

Boundless Connect tool
----------------------

The aim of the *Boundless Connect* tool is to help the user to setup the
`Boundless QGIS Plugin Repository <http://qgis.boundlessgeo.com>`_ and install
additional plugins, both Boundless and 3rd party ones (depending on what have
been configured by the system administrator).

The tool will run automatically when QGIS is started for the first time with
the |connect_plugin| activated or whenever this plugin is updated.

.. note::

   If at the time, you don't want to enter your credentials and install plugins,
   you can safely close it. While the tool starts automatically only once, you can
   open it at any time from the :menuselection:`Plugins --> Boundless Connect`
   menu item.

If your organization works with the remote *Boundless QGIS Plugin Repository*,
you  will need to enter `Boundless Connect <https://connect.boundlessgeo.com/>`_
credentials in the :guilabel:`email` and :guilabel:`password` fields, and press
:guilabel:`OK` to have access to the repository.

After pressing the :guilabel:`OK` button, |connect_plugin| will save your credentials
in QGIS's authentication database.

.. note::

   If you haven't done this before, QGIS will ask you to set a **master password**.
   The *master password* is used to protect all your credentials inside QGIS,
   for example, usernames and passwords for connecting to spatial databases. Choose
   your master password wisely and make sure you memorize it, as **the master
   password is not retrievable**. Press :guilabel:`OK`to complete the process.

   Setting QGIS master authentication password

   If you already have a master password, you will be asked to enter it to be able unlock
   QGIS's authentication database and save your *Boundless Connect* credentials in it.

   Entering QGIS master authentication password

If the |connect_plugin| was configured to use a local directory-based
repository (check this with your system administrator), you can leave
:guilabel:`Email` and :guilabel:`Password` fields empty. Press :guilabel:`OK`
to continue. (In this case you won't be asked for a master password.)

After entering the *Boundless Connect* credentials, the QGIS *Plugin Manager* will
open only with Boundless plugins available. This makes it easier to find and install them.

.. note::

   In this case, *Plugin Manager* is opened in the :guilabel:`Not Installed`
   tab. At this tab, you will see only Boundless plugins available from the
   *Boundless QGIS Plugin Repository*. At the same time, in the :guilabel:`Installed`
   tab, you will see all core C++ plugins as well as all Python plugins
   (Boundless and 3rd party) already installed.

Beside the plugins installed by the user, if previously configured by the system
administrator, |connect_plugin| will install additional predefined plugins (see
:ref:`add-additional-plugins` section for more details about it).

.. _updating-plugins:

Updating plugins
----------------

By default |connect_plugin| configure QGIS to check plugin updates every month.
This check performed on QGIS start, and if updates found, you will see
corresponding message in QGIS statusbar

.. figure:: img/update-available.png
   :align: center

   Plugin update available

Clicking on this message will open QGIS *Plugin Manager*, where you can select
which plugins to update.

.. note::

   When the *Check for updates* is activated, you will be requested to enter
   your master password after QGIS start. This is necessary to check updates in
   *Boundless Plugins Repository*.

If you don't want be notified about plugin updates or want check for updates
more frequently, open *Plugin Manager* from
:menuselection:`Plugins --> Manage and Install Plugins...` menu, go to the
:guilabel:`Settings` tab and edit options.

Plugins installation
--------------------

Using |connect_plugin|, plugin installation can be performed in several
different ways:

* :ref:`from-remote-repository`
* :ref:`from-local-repository` (through |connect_plugin| only)
* :ref:`from-zip-package` (through |connect_plugin| only)

.. _from-remote-repository:

From a remote plugin repository
...............................

This is the most common way to install plugins, whether from QGIS Official
Plugins Repository, Boundless QGIS Plugins Repository or any other remote
repository that you may have configured, using the *Plugin Manager* directly
or through the *Boundless Connect* tool.

.. note::

   If your organization works with the remote *Boundless QGIS Plugin Repository*
   it will be necessary to provide credentials to fully access the repository.
   This can be done using the :ref:`connect-tool` as described above or
   setting them manually using the QGIS *Plugin Manager* settings.

.. _from-local-repository:

From a local repository
.......................

Using |connect_plugin| it's possible to use a local path or network path as
a repository (see :ref:`configure-repository-location` section for details on
how to set a local repository). If any repository was set that way, the
|connect_plugin| will add an additional menu item in :menuselection:`Plugins`
named :guilabel:`Manage plugins (local folder)`. This tool should be used when
the user wants to install plugins from a local (directory-based) repository.
The usage is similar to the *Plugin Manager*.

To active, deactivate or uninstall plugins from a local repository, either the
*Plugin Manager* or the *Manage plugins (local folder)* tool can be used.

.. Note::

   Since the QGIS *Plugin Manager* does not support directory-based repositories
   yet, when you uninstall a plugin, previously installed from Boundless local
   directory-based repository, the following warning will be shown.

   .. figure:: img/plugin-uninstall.png
      :align: center

   This warning can be safely ignored, as you can install or uninstalled the
   plugin again using :menuselection:`Plugins --> Manage plugins (local folder)`
   menu item.

.. _from-zip-package:

From a plugin ZIP package
.........................

If you have a plugin package (e.g. previously downloaded from any repository or
GitHub) you can easily install it using the |connect_plugin|, without the need
to unpackage it. Go to :menuselection:`Plugins --> Install plugin from ZIP`,
browse to the directory with plugin zip package and select the corresponding
file. If the zip file is a valid QGIS plugin package it will be installed and
activated.

To deactivate or remove plugins installed whis way, like before, one can use
QGIS *Plugin Manager* from :menuselection:`Plugins --> Manage and Install Plugins...`
menu item.

.. _managing-plugins:

Managing plugins
----------------

All plugins added by |connect_plugin| can be deactivated, uninstalled or
updated using QGIS *Plugin Manager*. You can access it via the
:menuselection:`Plugins --> Manage and Install Plugins...` menu item.
