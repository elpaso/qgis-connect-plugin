General information
===================

The main goal of Boundless Connect plugin --- help users with setting up
Boundless Plugin Repository and make it easier to them install plugins and
their components.

Boundless Connect plugin is the only the one "core" plugin shipped with our
QGIS builds. It acts as "gateway" for all Boundless stuff like plugins,
tutorials, profiles, styles, etc.

Current implementation provides:

* First Run wizard for post-installation QGIS setup
* support for local directory-based plugins repository
* automated way of installing additional non-Boundless plugins
* ability to install QGIS plugins from local ZIP packages
